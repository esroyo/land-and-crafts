## La Pletera Itinerary Artifacts

Design of 12 elements that aim to bring people closer to the unique ecosystem of
the La Pletera Itinerary through sensory discoveries with a collection of
artistic and functional, sustainable, and artisanal pieces made with solid wood
and local plant fibers. These elements are of unique design conceived especially
for this territory and the inspiration arises from the same environment. The
objective is to promote the improvement of community values and foster a more
respectful relationship with nature, through an innovative and creative proposal
where nature, art and communication merge, following the biocentric design
trend.

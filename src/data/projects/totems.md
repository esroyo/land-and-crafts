## TÒTEMS
Ritual spaces, inspired by totemism, to reconnect people with nature. Through immersive experiences, the project aims to awaken ecological awareness based on the interdependence between humans and other living beings. The totems are functional and interactive, and can be used both vertically and horizontally. Made with natural materials of local origin, which come from forest management, they are conceived for impermanence, integrating back into the landscape and gradually disappearing over time. The project operates on three levels: physical, aesthetic and poetic, promoting a biocentric and multi-species perspective that challenges anthropocentrism and strengthens the feeling of belonging to nature.
